# ğŸš€ HomeLab Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Observability

This repository contains the configuration files for my home laboratory environment based on a Dell OptiPlex server. The project focuses on automation, network security, and centralized observability.

## ğŸŒŸ Key Features
Unified Dashboard: Centralized access via GetHomepage with real-time API integration (CPU/RAM/Disk metrics).
Full Observability Stack: Implementation of Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for centralized metrics and log management.
Service Monitoring: 24/7 availability checks with Uptime Kuma providing historical status bars.
Local DNS Management: Network-wide ad-blocking and .lab domain resolution via AdGuard Home.
Reverse Proxy: SSL management and internal routing using Nginx Proxy Manager.
Password Management: Vaultwarden self-hosted for maximum privacy and security.ğ

## Ÿ›¡ï¸ Security Hardening
Zero-Exposure: No ports are forwarded on the router. Access is restricted to the internal network.
Firewall (UFW): Strict "Allow" policy only for the local subnet. All other incoming traffic is denied.
Remote Access: Secure access via Tailscale VPN (Zero-Trust Remote Access architecture).
Secret Management: Sensitive data is managed via environment variables to prevent accidental exposure.ğ

## Ÿ—ï¸ Traffic Flow
User -> Tailscale -> AdGuard Home (DNS) -> NPM (Reverse Proxy) -> Docker Container

##ğŸ’» Hardware Specification
Model: Dell OptiPlex 7040
OS: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
Management: Docker Compose & Git-based configuration.
